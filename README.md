# TCPServerClientExample
A hobby Qt/C++ project demonstrating multithreading, TCP/IP socket communication, encryption, and custom rendering in QML using QQuickPaintedItem.
## Overview

**TCPServerClientExample** is a demonstration project built with Qt and C++. It showcases the following features:

- **Multithreading:** Efficient handling of concurrent connections.
- **TCP/IP Socket Communication:** Reliable client-server networking.
- **Encryption:** Secure data transmission between endpoints.
- **Custom QML Rendering:** Uses `QQuickPaintedItem` for advanced graphics in QML.

## Features

- Simple TCP server and client implementations.
- Thread-safe architecture for handling multiple clients.
- Encrypted communication using Qt's cryptographic modules.
- Custom UI components rendered in QML.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Qt 5.15+ or Qt 6.x
- C++17 compatible compiler

### Building

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TCPServerClientExample.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or run:
    ```bash
    qmake
    make
    ```

### Running

- Launch the server and client executables from the build directory.
- Configure IP and port as needed in the UI.
